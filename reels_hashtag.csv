Don’t miss Moorea, Bora Bora & Rangiroa. 🐪 Oman: If you love Morocco you will LOVE Oman (plus you can skip all the tourist lines because Oman is still fairly untravelled). Oman’s architecture is out of this world, it’s so naturally beautiful I could cry(!!), the people are so welcoming & its easy (& safe) to do a road trip. 🌵 Mexico: Tacos, surfing, jungle vibes, happy humans, waterfalls, incredible food & pristine beaches. Although I love the East Coast (Tulum etc) I recommend trying to West Coast & including Todos Santos & Sayulita on your itinerary! 🐢 Seychelles: Giant tortoises, crazy blue water, tiny islands to explore & a tropical vibe like no other! 🦘Australia: Snorkel the Great Barrier Reef, eat the yummiest vegan food in Byron Bay, explore the Cape Le Grand National Park in Esperance, rent a boat & sail the Whitsundays & go island / waterfall hopping in Far North Queensland. One of the best countries in the entire world!! 🐠 Maldives: A water wonderland & ultimate heaven on earth.

wanderlust,https://www.tiktok.com/@romania/video/7351152175386578209,"Could you do it? 90 years old and still making the youngsters look like amateurs. In a tucked-away corner of Romania, where time seemed to have frozen in a poignant dance with tradition, I stumbled upon a living testament to the indomitable spirit of life. A grandma, a matriarch in the heart of her village, carving poetry with a scythe in her “batatura,” the courtyard that cradled generations of stories. This wasn’t just about cutting grass; it was an ode to survival etched in every swing of the weathered scythe. An elderly woman, a silhouette against the backdrop of rolling hills and rustic charm, maneuvering a tool almost as ancient as her. The rhythmic cadence of the blade carving through the grass sang a ballad of resilience that transcended the boundaries of time. It was as if the scythe itself held the secrets of a thousand lifetimes, whispered through the hands of those who had faced hardship head-on. In the heart of Romanian villages, where the air is heavy with the tales of survival and shared history, the elders cultivate more than just crops. Our grandma, with her face etched in lines of laughter and wisdom, was a guardian of a fading dialect – the language of resilience, of grit. The scythe, a silent protagonist in this tale, became a bridge connecting the elderly to the present, a tool passed down like an heirloom, carrying the weight of memories in its worn blade. As she honed that blade with a special stone and cleaned it with freshly cut grass, it wasn’t just about maintaining a tool; it was a ritual, a communion with a way of life that had weathered storms and stood resilient against the test of time.

Wander deep into the untamed heart of the Carpathian wilderness, where the air pulses with the primal vibes of a true king—meet cerbul, the stag. This beast, a living emblem of unbridled beauty, roams Romania’s wild landscapes, casting an ancient spell on those who dare to step into its kingdom. Picture the stag, a majestic silhouette against the backdrop of lush undergrowth, its antlers soaring into the heavens. It moves with the swagger of a guardian of the wild, a noble entity that demands respect with every elegant stride. Witness the spectacle as it sheds and regrows its antlers—a natural show that echoes the rhythmic pulse of these ageless forests. As this majestic creature traverses the rugged terrain, it carries more than just its imposing physicality. It’s a living legend, woven into the very soul of Romania through tales and folklore. The stag isn’t just a symbol of the wild; it embodies resilience, strength, and the delicate interplay between humanity and the wild unknown. Encounters with the cerb forge a connection to the primal spirit of the Carpathian wilderness—a symphony where history’s echoes harmonize with nature’s unyielding grace, creating a rhythm that resonates with every beat of the heart. How would you articulate the essence of the stag?

It’s unbelievable I have had this experience and was able to see this country. It definitely wasn’t the best time to visit, but this made my stay even more unique. I’m still processing all that I’ve seen, realizing I lived in a war zone. I have tried to document as much as possible and can’t wait to share it all with you! My anxiety and stress levels were high, and I almost didn’t go. So this experience just showed me once again that life begins outside of your comfort zone. 🙏🏽 Ukrainians are unique and beautiful people and I am grateful for the opportunity to witness the culture and daily life of this country! follow @hellobylouis for more travel insights ✨",hellobylouis

TIPS: ✨A room based on 2 people sharing was nearly always cheaper than a hostel (if you can go without aircon, this saves $$ too!) ✨ Buying train tickets are cheaper at the station than online platforms such as 12Go - buy ahead of time to avoid them selling out! ✨ This one’s a given, but opt for local and street food to save pennies ✨ ‘Pickme’ is a very cheap way of getting taxis in Sri Lanka, and any public transport is extremely low cost! ✨ We use ‘Get Nomad’ for our phone data on an eSim - this saves time and effort (compared with local sim) and easy to top up ✨ Lots of places in Sri Lanka charge for foreigners to enter such as parks. Even some temples would charge 15x the price of locals. Often we would find other things to do that weren’t necessarily on ‘top 10’ lists How did we do?!

I stopped to ask one of the local women, and she explained that now you just call a number, send the money, and take your charcoal. Easy peasy! Curious, right?

During a time when gathering in public was severely restricted and cultural expressions like tango and carnival were banned, these brave mothers found a way to protest peacefully. They gathered every Thursday in front of the Casa Rosada, creatively circumventing restrictions by walking arm in arm in circles to demand answers about their disappeared children. Their struggle is a poignant reminder of the power of peaceful protest and the enduring strength of maternal love. Despite facing the same grim fate as their children, the Mothers of Plaza de Mayo remain a symbol of resistance and hope, continuing their demonstrations to this day. Their story is not just history; it's a call to remember the sacrifices made for human rights and justice. Watch the full story and be inspired by their unwavering determination. Let's honor these incredible women by spreading their story far and wide. 🕊️",asadoadventure

Anyways, to the deets! PRICE: 365 rand pp (aka $26 CAD), drinks not included For the full menu you can look it up on their website, it’s quite the list but you get the idea from the video. There’s a bar where you can order all the wine and drinks you desire (we love that), and in between courses you can hit the beach or check out what they’re cooking up at the braai pit.
